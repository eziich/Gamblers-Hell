                                        Baal, known as "The Expeller", is the lord of this brutal domain.
                                        A massive, tank-like demon with crimson skin and three sets of jagged, razor-sharp teeth, Baal stands as the living embodiment of violence and destruction.
                                        His muscular, hulking form towers over the landscape, with immense horns like the claws of a beast ready to pounce.
                                        His body is covered in scars and battle wounds, as if every inch of him has been forged in endless conflict.
                                        His three sets of teeth—each row more menacing than the last—are a reminder of his insatiable hunger for violence and pain.
                                        Surrounding Baal are a legion of skeletons, their bones rattling with every step.
                                        These skeletal minions worship him as a God, their hollow eyes filled with blind adoration.
                                        They view him as the divine force that dictates the laws of combat and war, a merciless deity of destruction whose power is absolute.
                                        To them, Baal is not merely a ruler but the very essence of violence, and they follow his every command without question, willing to die in his name over and over again.
                                        Baal’s very presence exudes terror and raw power, and his eyes burn with an infernal glow.
                                        He doesn’t just rule over the Seventh Circle—he embodies it.
                                        His hatred for weakness and mercy is absolute, and he delights in forcing his victims to confront their own brutality.
                                        It is said that the souls condemned here can never escape, for violence is not just their punishment but also their eternal nature—they can never cease fighting, never cease spilling blood.
